# Personal Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. It showcases academic projects, my resume, portfolio pieces, a contact page, and a brief bio.

## Website Link
[Link to the Website](https://silianrail.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/)

## Technology Stack
The website was developed using the following technologies:
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Framework: React.js
- Version Control: Git
- Package Manager: npm

## MIT licence explanation
I opted for the MIT license for its permissive nature, allowing users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software without many restrictions. This is because I myself referred to a resource online for the project and hence believe in open sourcing and encouraging collaboration and widespread adoption within the developer community. The simplicity and lack of complex requirements in the MIT license also make it easy for others to understand and use the project in various contexts.

## Note: Please Read
This is written for the TA marking this assignment- (I was asked to write this in README under the directions of Professor Rajabi whom I eplained my situation)  
Initially, upon skimming through the assignment, I thought that we were supposed to create a Personal Portfolio website which I created on the repository- 'Personal-Portfolio'. However, later on, I read that the website was supposed to be created with the help of creating issues and hence, I created a new repository and set to work. Upon compeletion, I was unable to deploy the new repo on GitHub which I later found out was because you can deploy only one website for your Github Account.  
Hence, I explained my situation to Professor Rajabi who said that my repository and website will be considered seprately and also asked me to mention the whole situation in the README file. I request the TA to please mark my website and GitHub items seprately.

Lastly, I was also asked to cite how I created my website, I used the following youtube video to use React to create personal portfolio website-
